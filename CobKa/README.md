# CobKa: Apache Kafka in COBOL

## Overview

Welcome to **CobKa**, a COBOL-based implementation of Apache Kafka. This project fuses the relentless endurance of COBOL with the real-time streaming power of Kafka, proving that even the most entrenched legacy systems can join the modern data revolution. COBOL’s dominance in critical industries—banking, insurance, government—means it’s here to stay, not because it’s cutting-edge, but because it’s too vital to uproot. Instead of rewriting these behemoths, CobKa adapts the modern data stack to speak their language.

Apache Kafka thrives on distributed, fault-tolerant messaging. CobKa brings that capability straight to the COBOL world, letting mainframe systems produce and consume data streams natively. This isn’t about dragging the past into the future—it’s about building a bridge so they can coexist.

## Why COBOL?

COBOL underpins a staggering share of global transactions—think payrolls, ATMs, and tax systems. Its staying power comes from decades of battle-tested reliability and the sheer impossibility of replacing millions of lines of code without breaking everything. Modernizing doesn’t always mean rewriting; sometimes it means extending. CobKa reimagines Kafka’s streaming prowess in COBOL, keeping legacy systems relevant without forcing them to abandon their roots.

## Features

- **Producer and Consumer APIs**: Create and process Kafka topics directly in COBOL.
- **Batch Processing**: Harness COBOL’s knack for handling massive datasets efficiently.
- **Mainframe Ready**: Runs seamlessly on IBM z/OS or other COBOL environments.
- **No Middleman**: Native COBOL execution—no need for language translators or wrappers.
- **Real-Time Streams**: COBOL-friendly event streaming for the 21st century.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A COBOL compiler (e.g., GnuCOBOL or IBM Enterprise COBOL).
- A COBOL runtime environment (mainframe or otherwise).
- Familiarity with Kafka basics (topics, partitions, brokers).
- A willingness to embrace the old-school vibes of COBOL in a modern context.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cobka.git
2. Enter the project directory:
   cd cobka
3. Compile the COBOL source files:
   cobc -x PRODUCER.CBL CONSUMER.CBL COBKA-UTIL.CBL
4. Set up your Kafka broker details in `CONFIG.DAT` (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### Usage

- **Running a Producer**:
  Start the `PRODUCER` program to send messages to a Kafka topic:
  ./PRODUCER <topic-name> <message-data>
- **Running a Consumer**:
Launch the `CONSUMER` program to listen to a topic:
  ./CONSUMER <topic-name>

## Configuration

Modify `CONFIG.DAT` to point to your Kafka broker:
BROKER-HOST     "localhost"
BROKER-PORT     "9092"
PARTITION-COUNT 0003

## Project Structure

- `PRODUCER.CBL`: COBOL code for Kafka message production.
- `CONSUMER.CBL`: COBOL code for Kafka message consumption.
- `COBKA-UTIL.CBL`: Shared utilities for messaging and broker interaction.
- `CONFIG.DAT`: Configuration file for broker settings.

## Why This Matters

COBOL’s grip on critical infrastructure isn’t loosening anytime soon. CobKa doesn’t try to replace it—it empowers it. By porting Apache Kafka to COBOL, we’re showing that legacy systems don’t have to sit on the sidelines of the data streaming era. This is innovation through adaptation, not demolition.
